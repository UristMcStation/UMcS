	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>THE REALISM: Injectors such as syringes, parapens and hypos will not penetrate coveralls with thick material, this includes space suits, biosuits, bombsuits, and their head slot equivalent. Injectors now also consider where you aim, if you aim for the head it will try to use it through the head slot, otherwise it will aim for the body. To clarify, if you are wearing a space helmet and a doctor tries to inject you while aiming at your head, it will protect you until they aim for the unprotected body; same story for wearing a space suit and not a helmet.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>The syndicate shuttle has been heavily upgraded with a brand new technology which allows the blast doors to the entrance of the shuttle to AUTOMATICALLY close. Whoa. This brand new technology will help keep out those snoopy crew members.</li>

	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Magic Mania! Powerful new magical tools and skills for wizard and crew alike!</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Beware the new Summon Magic spell, which will grant the crew access to magical tools and spells and cause some to misuse it!</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>One Time Spellbooks that can be spawned during summon magic that can teach a low level magic skill to <i>anyone</i>! Beware the effects of reading pre-owned books, the magical rights management is potent!
		<li class='rscadd'>Magical Wands that can be spawned during Summon Magic! They come in a variety of effects that mimic both classical wizard spells and all new ones. They come precharged but lack the means to refill them once their magical energy is depleted... Fire efficently!</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Be aware of the new Charge spell, which can take normally useless spent wands and give them new life! This mysterious effect has been found to wear down the overall magical potency of wands over time however. Beyond wands the clever magical user can find ways to use this spell on other things that may benefit from a magical charge...</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>The Staff of Resurrection, which holds intense healing magics able to defeat death itself! Look out for this invaluable magical tool during castings of Summon Magic.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Be on the lookout for a new apprentice! This noble mage is a different beast from most wizards, trained in the arts of defending and healing. Too bad he still works for the wizard!</li>

		<li class='rscadd'><b>Nanotrasen Anomaly Primer:</b><br>
		Unstable anomalies have been spotted in your region of space. These anomalies can be hazardous and destructive, though our initial encounters with these space oddities has discovered a method of neutralization. Method follows.<br>
		<p>Step 1. Upon confirmation of an anomaly sighting, report its location. Early detection is key.<br>
		Step 2. Using an atmospheric analyzer at short range, determine the frequency that the anomaly's core is fluctuating at.</br>
		Step 3. Send a signal through the frequency using a radio signaller. Note that non-specialized signaller devices may possibly lack the frequency range needed.<br></p>
		With the anomaly neutralized and the station brought out of danger, inspect the area for any remnants of the anomaly. Properly researched, we believe these events could provide vast amounts of valuable data.<br>

		<li class='rscadd'>We at Nanotrasen would like to assure you that we know the pain of waiting five minutes for the emergency shuttle to be dispatched in a high-alert situation due to our confirmation-of-distress policy. Therefore, we have amended our confirmation-of-distress policy so that, in the event of a red alert, the distress confirmation period is shortened to three minutes and we will hurry in preparing the shuttle for transit. This totals to 6 minutes, in hope that it will give our <b>very expensive equipment</b> a better chance of recovery.</li>
