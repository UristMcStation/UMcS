### MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variables ingame to find a good speed for your server.
## To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame.
## Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals ingame.
## To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.

## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied. 
RUN_DELAY 0
WALK_DELAY 0

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types.
HUMAN_DELAY 0
ROBOT_DELAY 0
MONKEY_DELAY 0
ALIEN_DELAY 0
SLIME_DELAY 0
ANIMAL_DELAY 0


### NAMES ###
## If uncommented this adds a random surname to a player's name if they only specify one name.

#FORCE_RANDOM_NAMES


### ALERT LEVELS ###
ALERT_GREEN All threats to the station have passed. Security may not have weapons visible, privacy laws are once again fully enforced.
ALERT_BLUE_UPTO The station has received reliable information about possible hostile activity on the station. Security staff may have weapons visible, random searches are permitted.
ALERT_BLUE_DOWNTO The immediate threat has passed. Security may no longer have weapons drawn at all times, but may continue to have them visible. Random searches are still allowed.
ALERT_RED_UPTO There is an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times. Random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_RED_DOWNTO The self-destruct mechanism has been deactivated, there is still however an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times, random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_DELTA The station's self-destruct mechanism has been engaged. All crew are instructed to obey all instructions given by heads of staff. Any violations of these orders can be punished by death. This is not a drill.


### EXPLOSIONS ###

## Unhash this to use recursive explosions, keep it hashed to use normal style explosions.
## Recursive explosions react to walls, airlocks and blast doors, making them look a lot cooler
## than the boring old circular explosions. They require more CPU and are (as of March 2013) experimental.
## The default map is generally designed for the old style explosions in terms of security.

#USE_RECURSIVE_EXPLOSIONS
