<h1>Welcome to Testing Before you begin...</h1>

<i>This server is running a /tg/station13 Git build with a custom map and features.</i>
<i>The custom map and build is curently based off of the UristMcstation <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=123140.0">
<i>This is a medium roleplay server.  Roleplay is encouraged, and please don't be egregiously out of character.</i>
<h2>Server Rules:</h2>
<b>Click the "Rules" tab at the top of this window and read them!
If you aren't aware of our rules, you could be warned by
an admin or jobbanned! Poor conduct as a member of the
security force/a head/a silicon will not be tolerated. These roles will be treated more harshly should rules be broken.</b>
<p>Keep IC in IC chat and OOC in OOC chat.  Please don't discuss ongoing rounds in OOC or you will be muted.</p>
<p>No killing, except in self defense, or as an antagonist (and show restraint even then).  Sitting around watching isn't fun.</p>
<p>For a good idea of antagonist knowledge and how to react in-character, see <a href="http://baystation12.net/wiki/index.php?title=Identifying_Antagonists">BS12's "Identifying Antagonists" page.</a></p>
<p>If you have a problem or a question, <b>adminhelp it!</b>
We exist for a reason, and would like to keep the server fun. We can't predict everything, and questions are likely to crop up during play, especially with regard to antagonists. Asking won't hurt anyone.</p>
<p>Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have done unto you.  Try to keep things enjoyable for everyone.</p>
